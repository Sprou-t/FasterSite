Read docs/spec.md first; then perform two actions: 1) scan ../next-faster and write docs/research/nextfaster-findings.md, 2) write docs/research/unsplash-notes.md with exact Postman steps and curl examples for search, download registration, and selecting the small image URL; do not scaffold code or pages today.

Ask the human only for missing secrets (UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY) and confirmation of the sibling repo path; otherwise proceed autonomously and stop after producing both docs.

Tomorrow’s handoff: Propose a single ingest script plan (Unsplash→S3→Neon) based on today’s docs, but do not create files yet.
