# Unsplash Gallery with NextFaster Optimization

This is a high-performance image gallery application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and optimized using [NextFaster](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-nextfaster) patterns for instant navigation and image loading.

## Key Features

- **Instant Navigation**: Route prefetching for zero JavaScript download time
- **Image Precaching**: Intelligent image prefetching based on viewport visibility
- **Optimized Performance**: NextFaster-inspired optimization techniques
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive image gallery
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
